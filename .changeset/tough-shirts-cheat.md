Added `GoogleAICacheManager` utility to allow caching large content to be used in inference. This class is exported from the `@google/generative-ai/server` subpath. Breaking change: The `GoogleAIFileManager` class has been moved to be exported from this subpath as well instead of the `/files` subpath.
